# Predicting Coral Reef Bleaching
Full documentation can be found here: [Predicting Coral Reef Bleaching.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21144158/Predicting.Coral.Reef.Bleaching.pdf)

## Project Objective
Coral reefs play a crucial role in safeguarding marine ecosystems and coastal regions. However, they are increasingly threatened by climate change and global warming, which put their survival at risk. This project aims to investigate coral reef bleaching caused by climate change and use machine learning and modeling techniques to predict future bleaching events.
